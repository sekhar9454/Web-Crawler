# Web Crawler URL Tracker: Hash Set vs Bloom Filter

## ðŸ“‹ Project Information

**Course:** Data Structures and Algorithms  
**Roll Numbers:** 106124109, 106124019, 106124111  
**Project Type:** Comparative Analysis & Interactive Visualization  

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project demonstrates and compares two fundamental approaches for tracking visited URLs in a web crawler:

1. **Hash Set** - Perfect accuracy with higher memory usage
2. **Bloom Filter** - Memory-efficient with probabilistic accuracy

The application provides real-time visualization of memory usage, insertion speed, and false positive rates, making it an excellent educational tool for understanding data structure trade-offs.
