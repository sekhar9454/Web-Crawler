# Web Crawler

A modern web crawler built with **React**, powered by **Vite** for fast development, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
This project demonstrates a simple, scalable frontend interface for crawling and displaying web data.

---

## Features

* Reactive UI for initiating crawls and viewing results
* Real-time updates using React hooks
* Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
* Quick setup with Vite for hot module replacement (HMR)

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
* npm (comes with Node.js)
* Basic knowledge of React and Git

---

## Quick Start

### Setting Up from Scratch

Follow these commands to create a new React project with Vite and integrate Tailwind CSS.

#### 1. Create the Vite Project

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-project -- --template react
```

This scaffolds a React project named `my-project`.
(Replace `my-project` with `Web-Crawler` if desired.)

#### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd my-project
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 4. Install Tailwind CSS

```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
```

#### 5. Configure Vite

Create or update `vite.config.js` in the project root:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tailwindcss(),
  ],
})
```

#### 6. Add Tailwind Directives

In your main CSS file (e.g., `src/index.css`), add the following at the top:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

#### 7. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app will start at **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)** (or a similar port).
Open it in your browser to see the crawler interface in action.

### Using the Existing Repository

If the project is already set up (e.g., cloned from GitHub):

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sekhar9454/Web-Crawler.git
cd Web-Crawler
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Customization

* **Add Crawler Logic:**
  Integrate backend APIs (e.g., Node.js/Express) in `src/services/` for actual crawling.

* **Styling:**
  Extend Tailwind classes in components. Customize config in `tailwind.config.js` if needed.

* **Routing:**
  Use **React Router** for multi-page navigation if expanding beyond a single page.
